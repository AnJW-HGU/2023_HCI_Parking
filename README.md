### 3. Background
#### 3-1 problems
    - Since the COVID-19 situation has come to an end, a lot of students have returned to school 
    and the number of vehicles increased accordingly. Therefore, an insufficient parking lot 
    problem aroused. To solve this problem, we came up with the idea to show up parking spaces for 
    the users so that they can park more efficiently.The problem is that there are not enough 
    parking spaces to accommodate the increase in
    vehicles, which is causing inconvenience for students, faculty, and staff. This problem is 
    impacting the school's operations, as it is creating delays and frustration for those who are 
    unable to find a parking space, especially in the crowded morning.
#### 3-2 existing cases, examples, similar studies
#### 3-3 objectives
    - The goal of this project is to create a parking service that enables drivers to easily
    locate available parking spots in Handong Global University's parking lots. This service aims
    to reduce the time and effort required for drivers to find a parking spot upon arrival.

### 4. Methods
#### 4-1 Target user
    - Our target users are Handong students and faculty who use the Handong Smart campus 
    application and drive to school and look for a parking space in the crowded morning. The 
    Handong Smart campus application, which all Handong students use, allows students to access 
    diverse information in Handong. Since every Handong student has access to this application, it 
    will be great for our service to provide parking information through this existing 
    application. Through this application, we can solve the lack of parking lots.
