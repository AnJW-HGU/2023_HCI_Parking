### 3. Background
#### 3-1 problems
    - The problem is that there are not enough parking spaces to accommodate the increase in
    vehicles, which is causing inconvenience for students, faculty, and staff. This problem is 
    impacting the school's operations, as it is creating delays and frustration for those who are 
    unable to find a parking space, especially in the crowded morning.
#### 3-2 existing cases, examples, similar studies
#### 3-3 objectives
### 4. Methods
#### 4-1 Target user
    - Our target users are Handong students and faculty who use the Handong Smart campus 
    application and drive to school and look for a parking space in the crowded morning. The 
    Handong Smart campus application, which all Handong students use, allows students to access 
    diverse information in Handong. Since every Handong student has access to this application, it 
    will be great for our service to provide parking information through this existing 
    application. Through this application, we can solve the lack of parking lots.
